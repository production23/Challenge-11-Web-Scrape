### Overview

This project offers a comprehensive analysis of Mars weather data, 
providing insights into the temperature variations throughout the 
Martian year and identifying the coldest and hottest months in Curiosity's location.

#### Part 1: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

- Description: The script automates the process of scraping Mars weather data 
from a designated website, leveraging libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests. 
It proceeds to analyze the gathered data, extracting valuable metrics such as the
number of months on Mars, the duration of the Martian year in Earth days, and the 
atmospheric pressure variations over time. Additionally, it visualizes these insights
using matplotlib, enabling users to interpret the data more intuitively.

#### Part 2: Identify Coldest and Hottest Months in Curiosity's Location

- Description: This segment of the project focuses on identifying the
coldest and hottest months at Curiosity's location on Mars. Leveraging the 
previously scraped weather data, the script calculates the average minimum 
temperature for each month and highlights the months with the lowest and highest temperatures.
Through visualization with matplotlib, users gain a clear understanding of temperature 
fluctuations over the Martian year, aiding in scientific analysis and mission planning.

Both parts of the project provide valuable insights into Martian weather patterns,
contributing to our understanding of the Red Planet's climate and environmental conditions.
By combining data scraping, analysis, and visualization techniques, this project offers a holistic
approach to studying Mars weather data. Whether for scientific research, educational purposes,
or sheer curiosity, these tools enable users to explore and interpret Martian weather data with ease and accuracy.
